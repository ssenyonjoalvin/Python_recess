# Comprehensions (list, dictionary)
"""
Comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists and dictionaries.
Symbols used:
lists      [] square brackets //used to store multiple items in a single variable
dictionaries {} curly brackets //used to store key value pairs
"""

# Example 1 : List comprehension
#  creating a list of squares in range of 10
squares = [i**2 for i in range(10)]
# print(squares)

# Exercise 1 : Create a list of even-squares  in range of 20
even_numbers = [i**2 for i in range(20)  if  i % 2 == 0]
# print(even_numbers)

# Example 2 : Dictionary comprehension
# Create a ditctionary comprehension for favourite cars and count the lengths of characters
favourite_cars = ['Toyota', 'Benz', 'BMW', 'Subaru']
car_lengths = {car: len(car) for car in favourite_cars}
# print(car_lengths)


#  Exercise 2 : Create a list of tuple where each tuple contains a number and its cube for numbers
#  between 1 and 10 using a dictionary comprehension

numbers = {i: i**3 for i in range(1, 11)}
result = [(key, value) for key, value in numbers.items()]
print(result)
