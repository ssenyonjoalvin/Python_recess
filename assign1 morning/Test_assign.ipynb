At liftoff, the stage's five F-1 rocket engines ignite and produce 7.5 million pounds of thrust. To replace those goofy quantities with the far less retarded metric system (even though liters are considered part of the metric system they are the same as cubic deci-meters) you would say 770 cubic meters of kerosene {abbreviated as m3} and 1,204 m3 of liquid O2 [O2 is the symbol for oxygen]. We would also say it produced 33,600,000 newtons of force <abbreviated as N>.
